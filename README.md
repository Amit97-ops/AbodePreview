# RentHubPreview

RentHub (Abode) is a project I created to help tenants and landlords to converge to one platform. With this platform,
renters will be able to find, view, apply, and sign leases. Landlords will be able list, book viewings, collect rent,
and view credit reports/applications of potential tenants through the site. RentHub aims to become a full service site 
and will implement features allowing tenants to put in maintenace requests through the service and allow a communication
channel between tenants and landlords. Below you will find some features of the application so far
